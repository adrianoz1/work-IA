## Automations to Make Daily Work Easier with AI

Personal repository with automations, prompts, agents, and other AI resources to make my daily work as a programmer easier.

## Installing podman and lobechat

To create, manage, and use the agents available here, Lobechat was used: https://lobechat.com/

Lobechat is an open-source LLMs UI compatible with the main AI models in the market such as OpenAI ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Groq, and Ollama.

To run Lobechat, Podman was used: https://github.com/containers/podman Podman is a tool for managing containers and images, volumes mounted within those containers, and pods made up of groups of containers.


## Running lobechat on podman
```
docker run -d -p 3210:3210 \
  --name lobe-chat \
  lobehub/lobe-chat

running on http://localhost:3210/chat
```

```
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout fix/APAWEC-5470 && git merge main
git diff main..fix/APAWEC-5470 > diff_output.diff
